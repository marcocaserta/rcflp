27.05.18 : First implementation of the Capacitated Facility Location.

Compile it using:

> make

and run it with:

> ./bin/cflp -h

The option "-h" provides some guidance on how to setup the command line to
define some parameters. For example, use:

> ./bin/cflp -i data/orLibrary/cap61 -t 1 -v 2

to solve a small problem from the OR Library using the Multi-source
formulation. Other options can be obtained calling the "-h" flag.
