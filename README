27.05.18 : First implementation of the Capacitated Facility Location.
11.02.20 : Updated the command line options (added -e for epsilon)

Compile it using:

> make

(after adjusting the dependencies, e.g, cplex, etc.)

and run it with:

> ./bin/cflp -h

The option "-h" provides some guidance on how to setup the command line to
define some parameters. A detailed description of the command line parameters
can be found in the documentation, under Doc/html/index.html. Once the
documentation is open in a browser, look for "options.cpp" and then the
Detailed Description.

For example, to run the code on cap95NEW5 using a budget uncertainty set with
epsilon equal to 0.1, use

> ./bin/rcflp -i data/orLibrary/cap94NEW5 -v 4 -t 1 -u 2 -r 0 -e 0.1 

Other options can be obtained calling the "-h" flag.

NOTE: Please, be aware of the meaning of the flag "-r", as explained in the
documentation.
